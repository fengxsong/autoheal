#
# This example shows how to start an OpenShift node that is running as a virtual
# machine inside an oVirt environment.
#
# The playbook expects the IP address of the node inside the `instance`
# variable. That can be achieved using the `extraVars` field and templating
# mechanism of the auto-heal service. For example, the healing action could be
# defined as follows:
#
#   awxJob:
#     template: "Start node"
#     extraVars: |-
#       {
#         "instance": "{{ $labels.instance }}"
#       }
#
# That will populate the `instance` variable with the value of the `instance`
# label of the alert, which will be the IP address of the node if the alert is
# based in a metric obtained from the Prometheus node exporter. For example, an
# alert definition like this:
#
#  alert: NodeDown
#    expr: up{job="node-exporter"} == 0
#    for: 1m
#    labels:
#      severity: critical
#    annotations:
#      description: Node {{ $labels.instance }} is down
#
# Will produce an alert with this label, containing the IP address and the port
# number of the metrics endpoint of the node:
#
#   instance="192.168.0.6:9100"
#
# To use this playbook the credentials for the oVirt environment have to be
# available in a credential inside the AWX server.
#

- name: Start node
  hosts: localhost

  tasks:

  # Calculate the IP address from the `instance` input variable, and then do a
  # reverse DNS lookup to find the FQDN. We do this because we are assuming that
  # the name of the virtual machine in the oVirt environment is equal to the
  # FQDN.

      vm_ip: "{{ instance | regex_replace(':.*$') }}"
  - set_fact:

  # Retrieve the facts of the virtual machine, so that we can check that it
  # exists:
  - ovirt_vms_facts:
      pattern: "name={{ vm_name }}"
  - debug:
      var: ovirt_vms

  # Fail if the virtual machine doesn't exist:
  - fail:
