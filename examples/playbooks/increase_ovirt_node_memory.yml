#
# This example shows how to increase the amount of memory of an OpenShift node
# that is running as a virtual machine inside an oVirt environment.
#
# The playbook expects the IP address of the node inside the `instance`
# variable. That can be achieved using the `extraVars` field and templating
# mechanism of the auto-heal service. For example, the healing action could be
# defined as follows:
#
#   awxJob:
#     template: "Increase node memory"
#     extraVars: |-
#       {
#         "instance": "{{ $labels.instance }}"
#       }
#
# That will populate the `instance` variable with the value of the `instance`
# label of the alert, which will be the IP address of the node if the alert is
# based in a metric obtained from the Prometheus node exporter. For example, an
# alert definition like this:
#
#  alert: NodeMemoryLow
#    expr: node_memory_MemAvailable / node_memory_MemTotal < 0.2
#    for: 1m
#    labels:
#      severity: warning
#    annotations:
#      description: Available memory in node {{ $labels.instance }} is too low
#
# Will produce an alert with this label, containing the IP address and the port
# number of the metrics endpoint of the node:
#
#   instance="192.168.0.6:9100"
#
# To use this playbook the credentials for the oVirt environment have to be
# available in a credential inside the AWX server.
#
